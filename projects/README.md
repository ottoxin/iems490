# Course Projects

This directory contains guidelines and resources for the IEMS490 course project.

## Project Overview

The course project is an opportunity to apply the concepts learned in class to a real-world problem involving Large Language Models. You may work individually or in teams of 2-3 students.

## Project Timeline

- **Week 3**: Form teams and submit project proposal
- **Week 7**: Submit progress report and preliminary results
- **Week 11**: Present project findings in class
- **Week 12**: Submit final project report and code

## Project Categories

### 1. Model Development
- Implement a novel architecture or training technique
- Optimize an existing model for specific use cases
- Develop domain-specific language models

### 2. Application Development
- Build an LLM-powered application
- Implement retrieval-augmented generation systems
- Create specialized agents or chatbots

### 3. Analysis and Evaluation
- Conduct comprehensive benchmarking studies
- Analyze model behavior and limitations
- Study scaling laws or emergent properties

### 4. Safety and Alignment
- Develop methods for improving model safety
- Study bias and fairness in LLMs
- Implement alignment techniques
