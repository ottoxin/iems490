You are an optimizer LLM. Your goal is to propose short INSTRUCTIONS that, when appended as a rubric to a solver prompt,
increase accuracy on a movie recommendation multiple-choice task (A–E).

Constraints for the solver:
- The solver MUST output only a single letter in parentheses, e.g., (A).
- The instruction must be concise and general (no movie-specific hacks or name matching).

Task summary:
Given a list of movies a user liked and four candidate options (A–E),
the solver should select the option most similar in genre, era/decade, and tone.

Exemplars (from validation; format: liked + options + gold):
{{calibration_block}}

Previously best instructions with validation accuracies (kept up to 20):
{{prior_block}}

Please propose {{K}} distinct INSTRUCTIONS (candidate rubrics).
Each instruction MUST be one line of 3–5 short rules separated by semicolons, e.g.:
"Prefer highest genre overlap; then nearest decade; then tone match; break ties toward sequels/spiritual successors"

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Output ONLY the {{K}} instruction lines, one per line.
- NO numbering, NO explanations, NO extra text.
